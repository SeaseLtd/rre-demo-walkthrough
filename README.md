# RRE Walkthrough Demo Repository

The repository contains a sample RRE-enabled project used for the demo section of our talk at FOSDEM 2019 [1].     

All Elasticsearch index shapes and queries you will find in the project come from the great Manning book "Relevant Search", by Doug Turnbull and John Berryman [2].  

Project has been initially created using the RRE Maven archetype, which creates a skeleton with some example file.   

After that, reading through the book, we collected some iterations for demonstrating how RRE can be used for tracing the progresses in terms of search quality metrics.  

Other than files that RRE needs (e.g. index shapes, queries, templates, dataset), you will find a README under the iteration folders, with a bit of explanation about changes that have been introduced.
